# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP

Twitter is one of the largest social media platform, where it is estimated that 6000 tweets per second are tweeted by people in the whole world related to different topics. The aim of this case study is to identify the emotions of the tweet, whether they are positive or negative. A dataset containing a large collection of tweets is taken and it uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets automatically as positive, negative.

I learned many new concepts while doing this project and in this readme section, I will highlight the major concepts used here for a quick overview.

 # Sentiment Analysis :
  It is the process of determining whether a writting or a statement is positive or negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is commonly used by businesses to better understand customer feedback.
 # Text Mining
  To derive meaningful information from unstructured data. Text mining is the process of exploring and analyzing large amounts of unstructured text data aided by software that can identify concepts, patterns, topics, keywords and other attributes in the data.
  # NLP - Natural Language Processing
  Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of artificial intelligence, computer science, and linguistics focused on making human communication, such as speech and text, comprehensible to computers.
  NLP Techniques include,
* Sentiment analysis: An NLP technique that analyzes text to identify its sentiments, such as “positive,” “negative,” or “neutral.” Sentiment analysis is commonly used by businesses to better understand customer feedback. 
* Summarization: An NLP technique that summarizes a longer text, in order to make it more manageable for time-sensitive readers. Some common texts that are summarized include reports and articles. 
* Keyword extraction: An NLP technique that analyzes a text to identify the most important keywords or phrases. Keyword extraction is commonly used for search engine optimization (SEO), social media monitoring, and business intelligence purposes. 
* Tokenization: The process of breaking characters, words, or subwords down into “tokens” that can be analyzed by a program. Tokenization undergirds common NLP tasks like word modeling, vocabulary building, and frequent word occurrence.
